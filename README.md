# danger-finger
Source code for the DangerCreations danger-finger, a DIY 3D-printable prosthetic finger device.

This is a pre-release, in progress.  Use at own risk.  Latest stable version is available at: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1340624

The project is undergoing a major rewrite, from OpenSCAD to Python 3 + SolidPython, a drastic improvement in reliable configuration to various shapes and sizes and needs as well as making the codebase easier to maintain and update.

When you run the code (e.g. python3 danger-finger.py) it will output a .scad file, which then must be opened and rendered with OpenSCAD.  In the future a web-interface and auto-render script will be provided for automating this part of the process.
